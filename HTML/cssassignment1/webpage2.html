Workbench
Split an editor without creating a new group
A new command Split in Group (Ctrl+K Ctrl+Shift+\) was added to split an editor into two sides without requiring a second editor group. This allows you to work in two editors side by side on the same file. You can also toggle the layout between splitting vertically or horizontally via the Toggle Layout button as seen in the short video.
